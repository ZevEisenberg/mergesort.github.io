If you've stumbled across my page, there's a good chance you're looking for a mobile developer (or you know, I've sent you here). ðŸ‘‹ Here's a [resume](https://fabisevi.ch/assets/Joe-Fabisevich-Resume.pdf) for you. 

I've worked on a lot of great products, at a lot of great places, with a lot of great people. It's been great. Most recently I was working at [Timehop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timehop/id569077959) and [Betaworks](https://betaworks.com/).

I co-founded and built [Picks](https://itspicks.com/), and before that I was doing interesting work at [Bitly](https://bitly.com/), [NYPL Labs](https://www.nypl.org/collections/labs), [Bondsy](https://bit.ly/the-verge-bondsy), and [Viggle](https://viggle.com/).

I'm fluent in Swift (love it), Objective-C, Java, and always exploring new languages. Go, Python, and Ruby are a step below in terms of comfort. I'm always flirting with Haskell and Elixir too. ðŸ˜˜

As a senior developer, I devote time to help growing developers in our industry. If you'd like some advice or guidance, email me. If I have free time coming up, donate $20 to a good cause if you can afford it ([my recommendation](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)), and we can setup a video chat, or lunch if you're in NYC and would like to treat me. ðŸ™‚

In the mean time, [here](http://feeds.pinboard.in/u:mergesort/t:learn-programming/) is an ever updating list of articles I've found incredibly helpful in my growth as a programmer. You can join others who subscribe to them [via email](https://mailchi.mp/7e97c77b67fc/programmatic-learning), and keep upping your knowledge. And of course there's an [RSS](http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/u:mergesort/t:learn-programming/) feed available too.

Anywhoâ€¦ Hello! I'm friendly and don't bite. I may scratch though.
