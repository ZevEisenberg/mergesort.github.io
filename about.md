If you've stumbled across my page, there's a good chance you're looking for a mobile developer (or you know, I've sent you here). ðŸ‘‹ Here's a [resume](https://fabisevi.ch/assets/Joe-Fabisevich-Resume.pdf) for you. 

I've worked on a lot of great products, at a lot of great places, with a lot of great people. It's been great. Most recently I was working at [Timehop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timehop/id569077959) and [Betaworks](https://betaworks.com/), [Bondsy](https://bit.ly/the-verge-bondsy), and [Viggle](https://viggle.com/).

I co-founded and built [Picks](https://web.archive.org/web/20160205044923/https://www.getpicks.me/).

I've also consulted with some great companies as well. Some of my favorites included [Teachable](teachable.com), [Tia](asktia.com), [Bitly](https://bitly.com/), and [NYPL Labs](https://www.nypl.org/collections/labs).

I'm fluent in Swift (love it), Objective-C, Java, and always exploring new languages. Go, Python, and Ruby are a step below in terms of comfort. I'm always flirting with Haskell and Elixir too. ðŸ˜˜

As a senior developer, I devote time to help growing developers in our industry. If you'd like some advice or guidance, email me. If I have free time coming up, donate $20 to a good cause if you can afford it ([my recommendation](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/)), and we can setup a video chat, or lunch if you're in NYC and would like to treat me. ðŸ™‚

In the mean time, you can check out the [newsletters](https://fabisevi.ch/newsletters) I maintain to help others learn and grow. There's one for [Swift](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/publicextension) fans, one which is an [ever updating list of articles](https://mailchi.mp/f0df17ad2511/programmatic-learning) I've found incredibly helpful in my growth as a programmer, and a way to keep up with [this blog](https://mailchi.mp/3237be1819ae/fabisevich-blog-posts). Full write-ups are available [here](https://fabisevi.ch/newsletters).

Anywhoâ€¦ Hello! I'm friendly and don't bite. I may scratch though.
