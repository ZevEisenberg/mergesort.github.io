Hi, I'm Joe. What's there to say about me? There's a lot, but I'll try and have some of my favorite quotes speak for me.

I guess the only thing that really says about me is that I'm the kind of person who saved ten quotes they found meaningful. I have many more, but you get the picture. In practice, I live my days trying to prove that you can get ahead in this world through kindness and consideration, while bringing others along with you.

At work I'm a senior mobile engineer at Twitter, which is a fancy way of saying I work on Twitter's iPhone app. I work on the [Health Client](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/health-update.html) team, where we focus on building product experiences to minimize misinformation, disinformation, abuse, and harassment on Twitter to improve the public discourse.

Outside of work I spend a lot of time [volunteering](https://twitter.com/AlexPaul/status/1317197327065559040), that is when it was ok to be around people. Nowadays I find myself doing [office hours](https://twitter.com/mergesort/status/1269382008570023936) sessions with underrepresented people in STEM. [People](https://twitter.com/coder_pilot/status/1273733450785189888) seem [to think](https://twitter.com/zoha131/status/1276896905834856448) they're rather [helpful](https://twitter.com/objectivechris/status/1272900957131747331), so if that sounds like something you'd be [interested](https://twitter.com/swiftysanders/status/1282011590531809280) in, please do [sign up](https://calendly.com/mergesort/office-hours). It's not mandatory in any way, but if you have apprenehsions about taking up my time, you can ease your guilt by donating to [great cause](http://www.blackgirlscode.com/).

In my free time I like to work on side projects that help me grow creatively. Some are fun, some are dumb, some help me learn, but all of them mean something to me and have shaped me into who I am today. And of course free time wouldn't be much without leisure, I like to unwind by biking around NYC, running, watching too much TV, and [reading](https://fabisevi.ch/reading-list) all kinds of books under the sun. 

If you're looking to hire me, well I've got bad news for you, I'M UNHIRABLE! That's because I'm currently very happy, not because I have awful personality traits. But if you want a resume here's my latest [one](https://fabisevi.ch/assets/Joe-Fabisevich--Resume.pdf). There's a good chance it's out of date, so maybe worth checking [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/devjoe) for something that may also be out of date, but probably less so.

There's a lot more to me, so don't be shy in [reaching out](https://twitter.com/mergesort). And if you're more old fashioned, I'm also reachable via [email](mailto:ireadeveryemail@fabisevi.ch).
