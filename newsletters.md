I believe in sharing knowledge as far and wide as possible. [Though](https://twitter.com/mergesort/status/929761136827928576) [I](https://twitter.com/mergesort/status/922089281258184705) [love](https://twitter.com/mergesort/status/929152992888188934) [RSS](https://twitter.com/mergesort/status/959087029983285248), it seems that newsletters are the way that most folks consume interesting learnings, so I run a few of those.

Posts are informative and infrequent, so there ought to be little impedement in signing up.

Programmatic Learning is a feed of articles I've read that I wish I'd read earlier in my programming career. Sometimes they're classics I'd never come across, sometimes they're new posts with a fresh perspective, and sometimes they're not even directly about programming, but they're always helpful.
