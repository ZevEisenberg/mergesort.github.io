Posts are informative and infrequent, so there ought to be little impedement in signing up.

Programmatic Learning is a feed of articles I've read that I wish I'd read earlier in my programming career. Sometimes they're classics I'd never come across, sometimes they're new posts with a fresh perspective, and sometimes they're not even directly about programming, but they're always helpful.
