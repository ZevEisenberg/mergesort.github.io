### Other's people writing is inspiring.

Sometimes I read a piece of writing that has me thinking for days or weeks. It's silly to keep all of the good stuff with me and only me, so I decided to start documenting it for others who may be interested.

Position on this list serves no relation to the writing's worth, it's purely chronological.
