I recorded an episode of the [Empower Apps](https://twitter.com/brightdigit/status/1360091529466023936) podcast, where [Leo Dion](http://twitter.com/leogdion) and I discussed a wide range of topics. We spoke about everything from how we scale app development to thousands of people and millions of users at Twitter, communication, documentation, people working together, and a lot about and the complexity of holding moral frameworks at a global level.
