title: A bigger iPhone

With rumors swirling about a bigger iPhone 6, I figured I’d touch on them (haha, puns). A few years ago, I thought the idea of a larger iPhone would be something I disliked. With my small-ish hands, even the iPhone 5’s 4 inch screen is too large for me to reach the back button in the top left corner of the screen with one hand.

But now, since iOS 7, I don’t fear a bigger phone, I would even welcome one. iOS 7 is very gesture driven, and has added edge gestures, which allow a user to go back a screen by swiping from the off the screen, on the left side of the phone. These are accessible to developers with one line of code. I really love using my iPad mini, but do wish that something I carry around with me all the time would be a little more pocketable.
