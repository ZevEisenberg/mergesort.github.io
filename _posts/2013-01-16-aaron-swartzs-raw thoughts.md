I spent a good amount of time over the weekend reading Aaron Swartz’s blog, shortly after his untimely passing. In short, I never new him, and so I don’t want to rehash everything that’s been said, but judging by what I’ve read, he was a brilliant person. So I leave you with a few blog entries that I found particularly insightful, interesting, and helpful. Some are longer, some are shorter, but I’d recommend giving them all a read.

* [On how to be more productive](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/productivity)

* [On learning (and failure)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)

* [On personal objectivity](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis)

* [On the news](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews)

* [On depression](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/verysick)

* [On pushing through pain](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dalio)

The first and second are the most powerful, and the last one’s the hardest, but each of them has it’s own merit. Hope these do something for someone.
