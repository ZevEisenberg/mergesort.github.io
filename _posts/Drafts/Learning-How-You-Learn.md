# Learning How You Learn

Books -> blog posts

Podcasts -> audiobooks was years of practice

Go to conferences, and don't usually take away that much UNLESS I force myself to sit and focus at the talksâ€¦ but networking and getting other people's opinions and perspectives on the talks IS ALSO LEARNING

Mediocre student, easily bored - Despite the cookie cutter approach school dictate, learning is the most personal experience out there, there's only one person in the world who learns exactly the way you do.

It takes a long time before you can start just digesting what you read. You're going to have to try out what you read for a while, to realize what it actually means. At that point you can manipulate it, tweak it, and see how things are when the variables change, which is when you'll really understand what things mean.

So how do I learn? The question is unimportant for two reasons. First of all. I'm not you, dear reader, so you have to figure out that answer for yourself. Secondly, I'm still learning how I learn every single day. What worked for me today may not tomorrow. The important thing is to be vigilant in the effort to learn how to learn, and accept that it is a process.
