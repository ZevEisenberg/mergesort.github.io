# How do I get started?

I received this email in my inbox a few days ago. Since it's a very common question, I figured I would answer it in public so maybe it helps someone else down the road.

Hi!

I saw your reply on Stephanie Hurlburt‚Äè's tweet about mentoring and was hoping you had time to answer a few of questions.

How do you approach learning a new code base? What do you look at first? What is/isn't helpful?

Thank you so much for your time!

Hey xxxxxx,

Definitely happy to help.

That's a great question. The key is to ease yourself in. You're not going to be able to understand in one day what people have been working on for months, a year, or even years.

I start off by trying to solve a small problem. Maybe it's to fix some strings, change some icons, or refactor a larger function and simplify it. A small task will give you a low friction way to start seeing your team's style, how they put together classes, functions, and map ideas into code. This will [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)) you to start thinking the way your teammates do. 

You may have your own opinions of whether what they're doing is good or bad, and that's completely fine. We all have those thoughts. The key to feeling confident about implementing code is to first understand the decisions that were made. It's possible you'll come in with an outside perspective and have all the right answers, but it's also possible that they're doing things you never even thought of. It's very likely that your thinking which will change over time. Of course you should never just accept something just because it is a certain way, but you also have to accept that about your own thinking as well.

That little divergence aside, as I mentioned above, start small and work outwards. When you come across things that don't make sense, after making a good faith effort, ask a teammate for help. If you don't know who to ask, you can run git blame and see who last touched the code. If you're not confident in that, you can always ask a teammate who you should talk to. Sometimes a problem is a little larger and than you feel you can't handle it without more understanding. If that's the case ask the developer to walk through it before starting. If the scope of the task is even larger than you thought, the two of you may want to pair program on the task. It's always better to ask questions to ensure you understand the task at hand than to go off and implement the wrong thing.

Even though I've been programming for years now, I still follow this advice when entering a new code base. The only thing that's changed is that the questions I ask are usually about philosophy and less specifically about code.

Hope that helps!
