I recorded an episode of  [@learnswift_fm](https://twitter.com/learnswift_fm)  with [Steven Sherry](https://twitter.com/steven_0351)  a couple weeks back. We had a great chat about contracting, computing history, philosophy, Smalltalk, and even a little bit about Swift. I think youâ€™ll really like it, and recommend giving it a listen.
