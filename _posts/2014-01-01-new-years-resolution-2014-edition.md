Last year I spent a lot of time gathering pieces, and in 2014 I'd like to put them together.

### More server-side programming

I’ve been doing iOS now for almost 5 years now. I always want to work on the whole stack, but I never have found myself drawn to a language that’s useful on the server. Recently I’ve fallen in love with the power and design of Go. Take what Ruby [offers](http://rubyonrails.org) you, with [web frameworks](http://www.sinatrarb.com), a [driven community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts), and the [clarity](https://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html) of Python.[^1] Now add static typing, with [Robert Griesemer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer), [Rob Pike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike), and [Ken Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson) behind it, and you have Go.

### More design

In 2013, I had the pleasure of working with a few amazing designers. Luckily [one of them](http://www.iamtimhoover.com) let me pester him relentlessly with every inane question and stupid idea I had. In 2014, the fruits of his labor should come to bear in my work.

### More hats to wear

I don’t mean this in the classic startup way, though [best](https://betaworks.com) part of [working](https://donenotdone.com) at [startups](http://get.viggle.com). Over the last year I’ve come to face it, I’m going bald. It’s pretty noticeable, my hairline is receding like glaciers in the North Pole. I decided to buzz it all off one day in November, and haven’t looked back since. Of course it was 25 degrees the next night, so I did regret the timing. But back to hats… I’ve always avoided wearing hats because I knew my time with thick hair wasn’t long for this world, and wanted to squeeze what I could out of it.[^2] What I didn’t expect was the white hairs in my beard… But it’s ok, [Natalia](https://www.metaprogrammed.com) thinks it’s endearing.

### Do good, not just well

More on this one later, but I can’t wait to show you what I have in store for 2014.

*Here's to a good 2014!…*

[^1]: If you want a commitment to clarity, just look no further than the [go format](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) tool.

[^2]: Wearing hats supposedly prevents oxygen from getting to the scalp, weakening hair folicles.
