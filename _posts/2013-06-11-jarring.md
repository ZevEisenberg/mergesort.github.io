* Based on beta 1 of iOS 7 (so take it with a grain of salt): from skeumorphic to schizophrenic.

* Lack of visual distinction between a button and a label is confusing so far.

* So is how thin the fonts are, making it hard to read. I am surprised they didn’t go with Avenir as their system font.

* I can’t wait to recompile all my apps just to get the status bar to work.

* Last but not least, the semi-translucent apps are very strange looking. The iPhone’s background actually affects how your app looks and feels.

That said, jarring isn’t necessarily bad. I’m looking forward to seeing what designers do. I don’t think standard UIKit was ever really good looking and this isn't either, but on the other end of the spectrum. Overall, as I said, hard to judge off beta 1, but I would definitely use the word jarring to describe it.
