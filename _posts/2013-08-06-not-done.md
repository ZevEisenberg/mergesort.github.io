We’re not done, but the new Done Not Done, coded by yours truly, is up in the app store. An app to keep track of the movies you’ve seen, music you’ve listened to, and books you’ve read, and for all the things you want to do.

It’s getting some much needed performance love before we resubmit (the whole thing went from nothing to done in 6 weeks).

More coming soon, but go and [get it](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/done-not-done/id582865085).

Editors note:
Betaworks shut down the app 2 weeks after we released it. I guess it actually _was_ done!
