iOS 6 ends up bringing a lot of interesting new features to the regular user, and looking over the API differences, not a lot on the developer side of things. iOS 5 was a gigantic leap for developers, starting with ARC, Storyboards, and a bajillion<a href="#-thats-a-technical-term-for-all-you-non-tech-savvy-folk">¹</a> APIs opened up. I’m willing to bet that this is becoming Apple’s calling card. One on, one off, is now to be prevalent in designing both hardware and software.

A pattern is emerging that makes it seem pretty likely:

* iPhone 3G, 3GS.
* iPhone 4, iPhone 4S.
* Leopard, Snow Leopard.
* Lion, Mountain Lion.
* iOS 5, iOS 6.

Every cool new Mac with features ahead of it’s time (hello retina display), it’s subsequent spec bump releases.

First you make something new, innovative, bold. Then you take the time to add fixes, polish and finish. Figure out how to make something awesome, get the margins down with your supply chain and economies of scale.

That’s what Apple have defined as their new strategy. Release and refine.
