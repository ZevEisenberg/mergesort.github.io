<h1 id="the-ipad-105">The iPad 10.5”</h1>

<p>I’m surprised. I’m truly surprised at how much I love it. I’ve had an iPad mini for years, and enjoyed using it when lounging around, mostly catching up on Twitter and RSS in bed. I thought there was going to be a good chance I return the 10.5”, but decided to go all in on it and see what came of it.</p>

<p>Quick thoughts (which I should turn into a blog post):</p>

<p>iOS 11 is fantastic. I’d rather run iOS 11 even if it was this buggy forever than go back to iOS 10.</p>

<p>Pencil is a game changer. Being able to just tap on the screen and start taking notes is amazing. I have wanted the Pencil since it came out, and was hoping it would come to the mini form factor, but gave up hope after there was no mini update earlier this year. The Pencil does live up to the hype, and I’m glad that I can save paper, which I waste of taking quick notes which then stay scattered all over my desk.</p>

<p>The screen size was a drawback at first, being so used to the mini, but after a couple of days with it, the mini looks so small that it feels fake. I actually did not want a larger screen, iPads have always felt large to me, but as a computer replacement it’s quite slim.</p>

<p>I just discovered keyboard navigation yesterday, and didn’t realize how full featured an iPad had become with a keyboard over the last couple of years. I still need to find a really good keyboard though.</p>

<p>Thumb typing is impossible on this thing, which is annoying for when I’m in the layback mode and browsing RSS, and someone texts me. It’s actually more convenient to put down my iPad, pick up my phone, and text them back. I don’t really have a solution to this, other than hoping my hands grow over the next few months.</p>

<p>This thing is so fast it makes my iPad feel slow, and my Mac feel ancient. Part of it is probably an illusion with the 120 hz screen, but it really is also just incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>I bought it with the intent of using it to make mockups, and turns out it’s even better than just that. I’m using Adobe Comp to make mockups really nice, exporting them to Marvel to do prototyping, and now I’m playing with Keynote for making animations.</p>

<p>Overall, it’s a knock out product. The iPad has come a long way over the last few years, and this iteration feels like they decided to really double down and invest in it all around.</p>
