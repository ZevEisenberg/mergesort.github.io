<p>#How I Use The Apple Watch</p>

<p>I live in the tech circle, but I try and keep a little bit perspective. There are some people who travel in our circle who have been rumbling about how they donâ€™t get enough out of their Apple Watch. ðŸ™„</p>

<p>There are also some who are calling it an enlightening device. ðŸ™„</p>

<p>In the end, itâ€™s just a device that may or may not enhance your life, how should I know? The product clearly isnâ€™t complete, which is similar to a lot of version 1â€™s that Apple ships. Instead of proclaiming my undying love, or eternal hatred for it, Iâ€™m just going to tell you my experiences using the device, an anecdote at best, and how Iâ€™ve found it to be pretty useful.</p>

<p>###Background</p>

<p>Iâ€™m reasonably bullish on the Apple Watch, but the first version has some annoyances though. I never ever ever want to tap that side buttonâ€¦ Iâ€™m not sending a horribly drawn doodle no matter how prominent you make that button. Almost all 3rd party apps are useless either because of loading time, poorly thought out ergonomics, or bad product decisions. The honeycomb of apps is incredibly difficult to navigate, which means I only access apps through the watchâ€™s complications. There is only a limited amount of utility I can get out of the watch faces, since theyâ€™re pretty rigidly designed, and selection is limited. Some of the nicer looking watch faces (hello Solar) donâ€™t even allow you to have any complications. Modular would be in my estimation 43% more fun if I could use a background image instead of black abyss. Other people have <a href="https://twitter.com/mmmknower/status/677906322176765952">remarked</a> to me that itâ€™s quite an oversight that you made a watch where you canâ€™t put the time front and center.</p>

<p>The good news is, itâ€™s not all negatives! These are definitely solvable problems, as long as Apple views them as problems. Some of these issues will be solved by Mooreâ€™s Law, or the Cupertino transistor version of it, and otherâ€™s can be fixed with pure product work.</p>

<p>On the positive end of the spectrum, the watch is comfortable, and while some may not like itâ€™s design, I think itâ€™s pretty good (which of course means it can be better). Appleâ€™s experience in making devices thinner and lighter should pay dividends in the years to come. Interchangeable watch bands have been a delightful surprise. The Apple made ones are <em>really</em> comfortable, and Iâ€™ve purchased many high quality knockoffs on eBay for a fraction of the price. I swap bands almost every day to match what Iâ€™m wearing, and its really a good experience, and fun. Notifications are terrific, and I use the watch as a filter, only sending really important apps to it; anything else can wait. Sleep tracking has been a revelation for me, and helped me realize that thereâ€™s more than meets the eye when thinking about the watch.</p>

<p>###Day to Day</p>

<p>The watch is a great device at executing a few small tasks that I repeat multiple times a day. As I mentioned, the ergonomics prevent it from being something I want to use for more than a few seconds at a time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>**Notifications: **I only let the really important through to the watch. iMessages, personal emails, direct messages on Twitter, and a few other things go straight to my watch. Everything else is a silent notification on my iPhone, which I can get to whenever I have time. Admittedly this is something that I could have done without the watch, but it ended up being a good impetus for me setting up these filters in my life, and Iâ€™m thankful I did.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Weather:</strong> San Francisco may not know what itâ€™s like to have erratic weather, but I live on the east coast. That means I check the weather a few times every day. The default weather app is nice, itâ€™s even good, but Carrot Weather is better. Besides the fact that my weather app is insulting me, it updates frequently, and the layout is very conducive for me to get a quick glance at the forecast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reminders and Calendar:</strong> Iâ€™m a busy guy with many important adult things to do, so I need to be reminded of all my critical appointments. The truth is actually Iâ€™m incredibly forgetful, so I write down *everythingâ€¦ *For me anything that can be forgotten likely will beâ€¦ until itâ€™s too late. I enter all my reminders and appointments on my phone, but itâ€™s nice to have them staring at me all day on my watch. Iâ€™ve even become proactive and sometimes take care of them before itâ€™s time to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Timers and alarms:</strong> This falls under the same page as reminders and calendars. I set a lot of timers. Itâ€™s really simple to set a timer or alarm on the watch with Siri, and then I have my wrist buzz when itâ€™s time to flip that filet mignon, remember to breathe, or whatever else I have to do in a timely manner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Activity tracking:</strong> Iâ€™ve always been <em>relatively</em> active by most standards. I grew up playing baseball and basketball, and now go to the gym once or twice a week. The last two years, I worked almost exclusively from home. I never realized though how sedentary I became, even with my gym visits. At first getting to 12 standing hours was hard because I just sat and coded all day, sometimes in bed, sometimes on the couch, sometimes in a chair. Getting to 12 hours became a breeze when I really started focusing on it, and I did feel better. Reaching my move goal became my next challenge. I got to that with a little effort by taking a few extra minutes on my walks to get lunch or dinner. Then once I started walking around, hitting my 30 minute exercise goal became much easier, taking just a few minutes. This isnâ€™t supposed to be about my exercise routine though. The watch isnâ€™t as insightful as a Fitbit or Jawbone Up, but itâ€™s rough enough to give me some insight I wouldnâ€™t have otherwise had.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sleep tracking:</strong> To me, this is a super interesting part of the watch. Iâ€™ve always had issues with sleep. Every so often I have bouts with insomnia, but in general, finding my target sleep duration has really been a key to my personal well being. When I sleep about 8 hours a night I feel much sharper, get sick less often, and am generally more happy. David Smith created an app Sleep++, which helps you track your sleep. Iâ€™ve been able to get good data about my sleep, and can see very clearly nights where I got enough sleep, was moving around a lot. I used to use a terrific app on my iPhone for this, but would end up having to keep it plugged in and turned on all night. If it wasnâ€™t in a charger, I could easily lose 50% of my battery to the app overnight.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>###A note on sleep tracking</p>

<p>To accommodate wearing my watch through the night, my charging routine has changed a little bit. Iâ€™ll put it to charge for a few minutes as Iâ€™m getting ready in the morning, and for a few minutes while Iâ€™m settling down to go to sleep, before sliding it back on. I also put it in airplane mode to not drain battery through the night, and also to not get notifications buzzing my wrist.</p>

<p>###Multiple watch faces</p>

<p>Something I realized a few weeks ago was that I wanted to have access to Sleep++ at night, but didnâ€™t want to have it cluttering my watch face all day. It then hit me, why donâ€™t I make a watch face specifically for night time?</p>

<p>During the day I want to see my activity and upcoming appointments, but donâ€™t have a use for that as Iâ€™m laying around sleeping. At night, knowing how much battery is draining, and having access to Sleep++ is much more important.</p>

<p>Night time is a different context than day time. I donâ€™t know if Apple thought of watch faces that way when they pushed it out to consumers, but if they did, theyâ€™ve done a bad job of messaging thatâ€¦ Or maybe my methods are just a hack, so who knows.</p>

<p>Is the Apple watch for you? Should you buy it? I donâ€™t know, do whatever makes you happy. I wanted to (and thereâ€™s still an an app I want to) build for it, and while I havenâ€™t yet, Iâ€™ve found a way to make it a useful part of my life.</p>
